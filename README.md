The entirety of our codebase is stored in the BurstIQ-Remedichain-Web-Application directory. 

In order to start the program, launch the GitHub repository and click on the “home.html” file within this directory. This will open up the homepage where users can learn more about what RemediChain is doing. From there they can click on the login button at the top right corner of the page. This will open a login page where users can sign in to the application using their BurstIQ login credentials. Upon signing in, the user will be directed to the home page. From here, the user can use the top menu bar to access their profile page - which contains links to pages for the donation, medication request form, and the available inventory - or they can access any of those three pages directly as well.

All HTML files needed for this project are contained in the root of the BurstIQ-Remedichain-Web-Application directory. 

All css components are stored in the "css" directory. Our css framework was Bootstrap.   

The entirety of our backend functionality is stored within the “js” folder within the “hello-medications.js” file. 

These functions are named:

loginRequest, 
addDonation, 
transferToInventory, 
pharmacistMedicationApproval,  
queryByAssetId, 
updateMedicationStatus, 
queryForInventory, 
displayInventory, 
transferFromInventory,  
addUserPrescription, 
queryByUserEmail, 
updateUserPrescription

There are detailed comments in the code which describe in further detail each of these individual functions.
